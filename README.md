# Artificial-Intelligenc-Term-Project
This is my Artificial intelligence project for my CS 470 Fall 2020 class.
This project will take input from an RGB sensor and have the AI guess the color of the RGB given to it.
If the AI guesses the color correctly then I will press a button on my breadboard.
If the button is not pressed by the end of the sleep funtion then the AI guess incorrectly.
All of the data will be sent to a data file and that will be used to train the AI.
